# nodehive-js
JavaScript client library for NodeHive headless CMS

## Note
This is a very early prototype and very likely break.

## Roadmap
We are working on a MVP which allows frontend developers to start using NodeHive in a matter of minutes.

We are currently focusing on

- Get the core functionality up and running
- Create a playground to test and explore data
- Create a beta release

## What is NodeHive?
NodeHive is a headless CMS solution built on top of Drupal.
